  <p>Climate change refers to long-term changes in temperature and weather. Such changes can be natural due to changes in solar activity or large volcanic eruptions. But since the 1800s, human activity has been the main cause of climate change, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil and gas.</p>
<p id="p2">Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sunâ€™s heat and raising temperatures. </p>
  <p id="p3">The main greenhouse gases causing climate change are carbon dioxide and methane. They come from using gasoline to drive a car or from using coal to heat a building. Land clearing and deforestation can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas-related activities are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and cultivation are the most important sectors that generate greenhouse gases.</p>

    <h2>Impacts of Climate Change</h2
    <p>climate change also have significant impacts which include.</p>
  <ul> 
   <li> Hotter temperatures</li>
    <p id="paragraph"> Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and make working outdoors more difficult. Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.</p>
   <li>More severe storms</li>      
    <p id="paragraph">As temperatures rise, more moisture evaporates, which worsens extreme rainfall and flooding, causing more destructive storms.</p>
   <li>Increased drought</li>
    <p id="paragraph">Climate change is changing water availability, making it scarcer in more regions</p>
    <li>health risks</li>
    <p id="paragraph">Climate change poses the largest threat to human health. Its impacts are already causing harm through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, mental health pressures, and increased hunger and poor nutrition in areas where food is scarce. Environmental factors claim around 13 million lives yearly.</p>
  </ul>

   <h2>Solutions</h2>
  <p id="sc">while it will be hard to solve climate it's not impossible and we should do something about it now for future generations.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep fossil fuels in the ground</li>
    <li>Invest in renewable energy</li>
    <p id="bp">solar, wind, wave, tidal and geothermal power.</p>
    <li>Switch to sustainable transport</li>
    <li>Protect forests like the Amazon</li>
  </ul>
